## 🚀 Quick Wins You Can Demo

### Week 1: Process Monitoring
```bash
# Build and run the agent
cd twn-agent
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/twn-agent

# In another terminal, execute some commands
ls
ps aux
whoami

# Watch the agent detect and log them!
```

**Demo impact:** "We're tracking every process execution with kernel-level visibility — no userspace tricks."

---

### Week 2: Crypto Miner Detection
Add this detection rule:

```yaml
# /etc/twn/rules.d/crypto_miner.yaml
name: crypto_miner_detection
severity: high
conditions:
  - process:
      path_regex: ".*(xmrig|cpuminer).*"
  - network:
      dst_port: 3333
actions:
  - alert
  - kill_process
```

**Demo impact:** "We detected a crypto miner and killed it in under 500ms."

---

### Week 3: Network Visibility
```bash
# The agent is already capturing:
# - All TCP/UDP connections
# - DNS queries (before resolution!)
# - IPv4 and IPv6

# Export to SigNoz for visualization
```

**Demo impact:** "We have complete network visibility — every connection, every DNS query, in real-time."

---

## 🎁 Bonus: What You Can Build Next

Once you have the Linux agent working, you can extend the platform:

### 🪟 Windows Support (Months 6-7)
- Use **ETW (Event Tracing for Windows)** instead of eBPF
- Same Rust agent codebase, different kernel interface
- Similar feature set (process, network, file monitoring)

### 🍎 macOS Support (Months 8-9)
- Use **Endpoint Security Framework**
- Again, same Rust agent, different kernel API
- Limited compared to eBPF but still powerful

### 📱 Mobile/IoT (Future)
- Android: Use eBPF (yes, Android has it!)
- iOS: Very limited, but some options via MDM
- Embedded Linux: Full eBPF support

### 🤖 AI-Powered Detection (Future)

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why eBPF is Perfect for This
1. **Kernel-level visibility**: See everything, no hiding from userspace
2. **Performance**: < 2% CPU overhead, even with all programs loaded
3. **Security**: Can't be bypassed by malware (kernel-space)
4. **Flexibility**: Add new monitoring without kernel modules
5. **Future-proof**: eBPF is the future of Linux observability

### Why Linux First Makes Sense
1. **eBPF maturity**: Linux has the best eBPF support
2. **Server dominance**: Most servers run Linux
3. **Container/K8s**: Critical for cloud-native security
4. **Open ecosystem**: Integrates well with open-source tools
5. **Cost**: No Windows/macOS licensing headaches

### Why This Beats Commercial Solutions
1. **Open source**: Audit the code, no vendor lock-in
2. **Self-hosted**: Your data stays on your infrastructure
3. **Customizable**: Write your own rules and detections
4. **Cost**: $0 per endpoint vs $40-120 for commercial
5. **Integration**: Works with your existing stack
